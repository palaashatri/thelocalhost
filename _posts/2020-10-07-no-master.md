Some of you know about [George Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Floyd), some of you don't. Anyways, May 2020 was an extremely tense month for everyone in the world, from massive violent protests to an extreme surge in COVID-19 cases, it turned out to be one of the busiest and worst months of 2020 and changed a lot of things that we knew about in the world.
The whole event and its aftermath can be read [here on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_George_Floyd), and I won't be delving into anything related to racial discrimination and any of the "#BlackLivesMatter" movement, and keep this section pretty much controversy-free.
Speaking of controversy-free, GitHub recently changed their branch naming convention, and "`master`" branches are now renamed to "`main`" in all new repositories, which serves as the default branch of all repositories on GitHub. According to [this article](https://sfconservancy.org/news/2020/jun/23/gitbranchname/), 
> "Both Conservancy and the Git project are aware that the initial branch name, ‘master’, is offensive to some people and we empathize with those hurt by the use of that term."

and its pretty sure inspired by racial-activists being offended by the old "master-slave" naming convention used in computer architectures since decades. I kind of understand their sentiments, but it isn't that easy to change your muscle memory from `git push origin master` to `git push origin main` in one fell swoop.

Still, I think its a good change, and I would request developers to check their repositories whether they refer to `master` or the `main` branch and avoid any unforeseen technical challenges and difficulties they might face due to the change in the naming convention, using `git status`. Its a handy tool, and will always help you cross-check your git repository's status.
